Testimonials

> “Fatma works hard to make sure we get every dollar we deserve from the insurance company. I have received work emails from her on Saturdays and Sundays, even holidays!! She seem to work all the time. She is thorough and appropriately intense about collections. Fatma is easy to work with and has always been accessible (usually immediately). Unlike other billing companies, her goal is to collect every dollar and not just the “low hanging fruit” that most billing companies do for doctors. If you are unhappy with your billing company, it is because you have not worked with Fatma!!!”
